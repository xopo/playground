take the following input data
[
    {
        "name": "John",
        "type": "dog"
    },
        {
        "name": "Sparky",
        "type": "dog"
    },
        {
        "name": "Nova",
        "type": "cat"
    },
        {
        "name": "Manuel",
        "type": "dog"
    },
        {
        "name": "Caesar",
        "type": "cat"
    },
        {
        "name": "Gill",
        "type": "fish"
    }
]

1. and group them by type
ex:
[
    {
        type: fish,
        animals: ['Gill']
    },
    {
        type: dog,
        animals: ['Manuel', 'Sparky', 'John']
    }, etc...
]

2. Given 2-3 animals that are in the list create an interesction of the list.
ex: given manuel and gill, intersect with the list of animals. Some animals may NOT appear in both lists, handle that case!

3. Given an array, generate a CSV representation of that array with a set of headers.
ex:
NAME, TYPE
Gill, fish
Manuel, dog

4. Create a function that can only run once and throws if it gets called again.5. Create a function that is given a set of functions and a set of data which are inputs for those functions and returns the one that finished the fastest out of them, displaying ms time
